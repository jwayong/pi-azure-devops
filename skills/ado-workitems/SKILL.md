# Azure DevOps Work Items, Boards, & Pull Requests

## Setup

Set these environment variables before use:

```bash
export ADO_ORG_URL="https://dev.azure.com/yourorg"
export ADO_PROJECT="YourProject"
export ADO_PAT="your-personal-access-token"
export ADO_TEAM="Engineering"        # optional — needed for boards/iterations/capacity
```

Or configure in `.pi/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "ado": {
    "orgUrl": "https://dev.azure.com/yourorg",
    "project": "YourProject",
    "team": "Engineering",
    "authMethod": "pat",
    "safetyLevel": "confirm"
  }
}
```

Run `ado_doctor` first to verify your configuration.

## Team Context

Most board, iteration, and capacity tools require a **team name**. The `team` parameter is optional on all these tools — they fall back to the configured default team (`ADO_TEAM` or `ado.team`).

**Workflow:**
1. If the user mentions a team by name, pass it as the `team` parameter.
2. If no team is mentioned, use the config default (no `team` param needed).
3. If no team is configured and none is specified, the tool returns an error — tell the user to set `ADO_TEAM` or specify a team.
4. Use `ado_list_teams` to discover available teams when unsure.

**Multi-team scenarios:** When working across teams (e.g., comparing sprint health), call tools once per team, passing each team name as the `team` parameter.

## WIQL Query Reference

### Basic Syntax

```sql
SELECT [System.Id], [System.Title], [System.State]
FROM WorkItems
WHERE [System.State] = 'Active'
ORDER BY [System.CreatedDate] DESC
```

### Common Where Clauses

| Filter | Example |
|--------|---------|
| By state | `WHERE [System.State] = 'Active'` |
| By type | `WHERE [System.WorkItemType] = 'Bug'` |
| By assignee | `WHERE [System.AssignedTo] = @me` |
| By area | `WHERE [System.AreaPath] UNDER 'Project\Engineering'` |
| By iteration | `WHERE [System.IterationPath] UNDER 'Project\Sprint 4'` |
| By tags | `WHERE [System.Tags] CONTAINS 'security'` |
| Multiple conditions | `WHERE [System.State] = 'Active' AND [System.WorkItemType] = 'Bug'` |

### Useful Queries

Active bugs assigned to me:
```sql
SELECT [System.Id] FROM WorkItems
WHERE [System.WorkItemType] = 'Bug'
  AND [System.State] = 'Active'
  AND [System.AssignedTo] = @me
```

All items in current sprint:
```sql
SELECT [System.Id] FROM WorkItems
WHERE [System.IterationPath] UNDER 'Project\Sprint 4'
  AND [System.State] <> 'Closed'
ORDER BY [System.Priority]
```

Unassigned active items:
```sql
SELECT [System.Id] FROM WorkItems
WHERE [System.State] = 'Active'
  AND [System.AssignedTo] = ''
```

Recently changed items:
```sql
SELECT [System.Id] FROM WorkItems
WHERE [System.ChangedDate] >= @today - 7
ORDER BY [System.ChangedDate] DESC
```

## Sprint/Iteration Reference

### Finding Sprints

Use `ado_list_iterations` to discover sprints. Pass `timeframe: "current"` to get the active sprint:

```
ado_list_iterations(team: "Engineering", timeframe: "current")
```

**Timeframe values:** `"current"`, `"past"`, `"future"`

### Iteration Data

Each iteration returns:
- **id** — GUID (needed for capacity and iteration work item tools)
- **name** — Sprint name (e.g., "Sprint 3")
- **path** — Full path (e.g., `Project\Sprint 3`)
- **attributes.startDate / finishDate** — Sprint date range
- **attributes.timeFrame** — `"current"`, `"past"`, or `"future"`

### Common Sprint Operations

| Task | Steps |
|------|-------|
| Show current sprint items | `ado_list_iterations(timeframe: "current")` → get iteration ID → `ado_get_iteration_work_items(iterationId)` |
| Check capacity | `ado_get_capacity(iterationId, team)` |
| Add a sprint to team | `ado_set_iteration(iterationId, operation: "add", team)` |
| Remove a sprint | `ado_set_iteration(iterationId, operation: "remove", team)` |

### Typical Iteration Patterns

Iterations follow the project's area path structure:
- `Project\Sprint 1`, `Project\Sprint 2`, ...
- `Project\2026-Q1\Sprint 1`, `Project\2026-Q2\Sprint 1`, ...

## Board Reference

### Board Types

| Board ID | Backlog Level | Typical Work Item Types |
|----------|--------------|------------------------|
| `stories` | Requirements | User Story, Bug, Task |
| `features` | Features | Feature |
| `epics` | Epics | Epic |

Teams may have custom boards with different IDs. Use `ado_list_boards(team)` to discover them.

### Column Configuration

Each board has columns with:
- **name** — Display name (e.g., "New", "Active", "Closed")
- **columnType** — `Incoming` (first), `InProgress` (middle), `Outgoing` (last)
- **itemLimit** — WIP limit (null = unlimited)
- **stateMappings** — Maps work item type → state for this column

Example state mappings for a "Stories" board:
```
Column "New":   { "User Story": "New", "Bug": "New", "Task": "To Do" }
Column "Active": { "User Story": "Active", "Bug": "Active", "Task": "In Progress" }
Column "Closed": { "User Story": "Closed", "Bug": "Closed", "Task": "Closed" }
```

### Modifying Board Columns

`ado_set_board_columns` **replaces all columns** — always `ado_get_board` first to see the current config, then modify.

**Workflow:**
1. `ado_get_board(boardId, team)` — inspect current columns and state mappings
2. Modify the column definitions as needed
3. `ado_set_board_columns(boardId, columns, team)` — apply the new set

## Capacity Reference

### Capacity Model

Each team member has:
- **Activities** — Work categories with hours/day (e.g., Development: 6h/day, Code Review: 1h/day)
- **Days off** — Date ranges when the member is unavailable

Team totals are computed automatically (sum of all member capacity minus days off).

### Reading Capacity

```
ado_get_capacity(iterationId, team)
```

Returns per-member breakdown with activities, days off, and team totals.

### Setting Capacity

`ado_set_capacity` **replaces all capacity** for the sprint — always `ado_get_capacity` first to see current values.

**Workflow:**
1. `ado_get_capacity(iterationId, team)` — see current values
2. Build the new capacity array (one entry per team member)
3. `ado_set_capacity(iterationId, capacities, team)` — apply

Each capacity entry:
```json
{
  "teamMemberId": "user@contoso.com",
  "activities": [
    { "name": "Development", "capacityPerDay": 6 },
    { "name": "Code Review", "capacityPerDay": 1 }
  ],
  "daysOff": [
    { "start": "2026-04-25T00:00:00Z", "end": "2026-04-25T00:00:00Z" }
  ]
}
```

### Common Activities

| Activity | Typical For |
|----------|------------|
| Development | Developers — writing code |
| Testing | QA — manual and automated testing |
| Code Review | Senior developers — reviewing PRs |
| Design | Designers — UX/UI work |
| Infrastructure | DevOps — CI/CD, cloud |
| Documentation | Technical writers — docs |

## Common Field Reference

| Field | Reference Name | Example Values |
|-------|---------------|----------------|
| Title | `System.Title` | Any text |
| State | `System.State` | New, Active, Resolved, Closed, Done |
| Type | `System.WorkItemType` | User Story, Bug, Task, Feature, Epic |
| Assigned To | `System.AssignedTo` | Email or display name, `@me` in WIQL |
| Area Path | `System.AreaPath` | `Project\Area\SubArea` |
| Iteration | `System.IterationPath` | `Project\Sprint 4` |
| Priority | `System.Priority` | 1 (highest) – 4 (lowest) |
| Reason | `System.Reason` | New, Implementation started, Completed, Fixed, Deferred |
| Tags | `System.Tags` | Semicolon-separated: `security; backend` |
| Description | `System.Description` | HTML content |
| Severity | `Microsoft.VSTS.Common.Severity` | 1 - Critical, 2 - High, 3 - Medium, 4 - Low |
| Value Area | `Microsoft.VSTS.Common.ValueArea` | Business, Architectural |
| Created Date | `System.CreatedDate` | ISO 8601 date |
| Changed Date | `System.ChangedDate` | ISO 8601 date |

## Work Item Type Conventions

| Type | Purpose | Typical States |
|------|---------|---------------|
| **Epic** | Large initiative spanning features | New → In Progress → Done |
| **Feature** | Group of user stories | New → In Progress → Done |
| **User Story** | User-valued deliverable | New → Active → Resolved → Closed |
| **Bug** | Deviation from expected behavior | New → Active → Resolved → Closed |
| **Task** | Implementation work item | To Do → In Progress → Done |
| **Issue** | Impediment or blocking problem | Active → Closed |

## Link Types

| Relation Type | Usage |
|---------------|-------|
| `System.LinkTypes.Hierarchy-Forward` | Parent → Child (Epic→Feature, Feature→Story, Story→Task) |
| `System.LinkTypes.Hierarchy-Reverse` | Child → Parent |
| `System.LinkTypes.Related` | Related work items |
| `System.LinkTypes.Duplicate` | Duplicate work items |
| `System.LinkTypes.Duplicate-Reverse` | Original of a duplicate |
| `System.LinkTypes.Dependency` | Successor depends on predecessor |
| `System.LinkTypes.Dependency-Reverse` | Predecessor of a dependency |

## Safety Model

The safety level controls how mutation tools behave:

- **`open`** — No confirmation needed. Tools execute immediately.
- **`confirm`** (default) — User sees a confirmation dialog before each mutation.
- **`readonly`** — All mutation tools are blocked. Only read operations allowed.

Set via `ADO_SAFETY_LEVEL` env var or `ado.safetyLevel` in settings.

## Mock Mode

For testing without ADO credentials:

```bash
ADO_MOCK=1 pi "Show me work item #101"
```

Or pass `{ "mock": true }` to any tool's parameters.

## Best Practices

1. **Always run `ado_doctor` first** in a new session to verify configuration.
2. **Use `ado_list_work_item_types`** before creating work items to confirm valid types.
3. **Prefer WIQL queries** over multiple individual fetches when searching for work items.
4. **Set `System.Tags`** when creating to improve discoverability.
5. **Use `ado_get_work_item_revisions`** to understand the history before updating.
6. **Link parent/child items** using `ado_manage_work_item_links` to maintain hierarchy.
7. **Use `ado_list_iterations(timeframe: "current")`** instead of hardcoded sprint names — sprints change.
8. **Always `ado_get_board` before `ado_set_board_columns`** — the set operation replaces all columns.
9. **Always `ado_get_capacity` before `ado_set_capacity`** — the set operation replaces all capacity data.
10. **List boards before modifying** — use `ado_list_boards(team)` to find the correct board ID.
11. **Use `ado_list_repos` first** when working with PRs — you'll need the repository ID for most PR operations.
12. **Check `ado_get_pull_request_threads` before commenting** — review existing discussion to avoid duplicates.
13. **Check `ado_get_policy_evaluations` before approving** — verify all policies are passing.
14. **Use full ref names** (`refs/heads/feature/login`) when specifying source/target branches for PRs.
15. **Use `ado_list_pull_requests(status: "active")`** to find open PRs — don't guess PR IDs.

## Repository Reference

### Identifying Repositories

Most repo/PR tools accept `repositoryId` which can be either:
- **Repository name** — e.g., `"webapp"`, `"api-service"` (human-friendly)
- **Repository GUID** — e.g., `"repo-webapp"` (stable across renames)

**Workflow:** Use `ado_list_repos` first to discover available repos, then use the name or ID for branch and PR operations.

### Branch Name Formats

The ADO API uses full ref names internally: `refs/heads/main`. Short names (`main`) are displayed in formatted output.

When passing `sourceRefName` or `targetRefName` to tools, always use the full ref format:
```
refs/heads/feature/login
refs/heads/hotfix/auth-fix
refs/heads/release/v2.0
```

### Common Branch Patterns

| Pattern | Purpose |
|---------|----------|
| `main` | Default branch (production) |
| `develop` | Integration branch |
| `feature/*` | New feature development |
| `hotfix/*` | Urgent production fixes |
| `release/*` | Release preparation |
| `bugfix/*` | Bug fixes (non-urgent) |

### Ahead/Behind Counts

Branches show `↑N ↓M` tracking info:
- `↑N` = N commits ahead of base
- `↓M` = M commits behind base
- `(base)` = this is the branch others track against

## Pull Request Reference

### PR Status Values

| Status | Description |
|--------|------------|
| `active` | Open and under review |
| `abandoned` | Closed without merging |
| `completed` | Successfully merged |

### PR Lifecycle

```
ado_create_pull_request → ado_get_pull_request_threads → review code →
ado_add_pull_request_comment → ado_set_pull_request_vote → (auto-complete or manual merge)
```

**Typical workflow:**
1. `ado_list_branches(repoId)` — see available branches
2. `ado_create_pull_request(repoId, source, target, title)` — create PR
3. `ado_get_pull_request_threads(repoId, prId)` — check existing discussion
4. `ado_add_pull_request_comment(repoId, prId, content)` — add feedback
5. `ado_set_pull_request_vote(repoId, prId, vote)` — approve or reject
6. `ado_get_policy_evaluations(prId)` — check if all policies pass

### Vote Values

| Vote String | Numeric | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|----------|
| `approve` | 10 | PR looks good, ready to merge |
| `approve-with-suggestions` | 5 | Approve, but consider minor changes |
| `waiting-for-author` | -5 | Changes needed before approval |
| `reject` | -10 | Should not merge |
| `reset` | 0 | Remove previous vote |

### PR Comment Threads

PR comments are organized into **threads**, each with a status:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|----------|
| `active` (1) | Open for discussion |
| `fixed` (2) | Issue resolved |
| `wontfix` (3) | Won't be fixed |
| `closed` (4) | Thread closed |
| `pending` (6) | Awaiting response |

When adding a comment, you can set `threadStatus` to control the thread state.

### Draft PRs

Create a draft PR with `isDraft: true` to signal work-in-progress. Draft PRs cannot be merged until marked ready.

### Common PR Search Patterns

```
// All active PRs in the project
ado_list_pull_requests(status: "active")

// PRs created by a specific person
ado_list_pull_requests(creator: "alice@contoso.com", status: "active")

// PRs in a specific repo
ado_list_pull_requests(repositoryId: "webapp", status: "active")

// PRs targeting main
ado_list_pull_requests(targetRefName: "refs/heads/main", status: "active")

// Recently completed PRs
ado_list_pull_requests(status: "completed", top: 10)
```

## Policy Reference

### Common Policy Types

| Policy | Purpose |
|--------|----------|
| Minimum reviewers | Requires N approvals before merge |
| Build validation | CI pipeline must pass |
| Required reviewer | Specific team/person must review |
| Work item linking | PR must have linked work items |
| Comment requirements | All comments must be resolved |

### Policy Evaluation Status

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|----------|
| ✅ Approved | Policy satisfied |
| ⏳ Running | Evaluation in progress |
| ❌ Rejected | Policy not satisfied (blocking merge) |
| ➖ Not applicable | Policy doesn't apply to this PR |

**Workflow:** Check `ado_get_policy_evaluations(prId)` before approving/voting to see if any policies are blocking.

## Error Handling

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| "Authentication failed" | Check `ADO_PAT` or run `az login`. Use `ado_doctor` to diagnose. |
| "Project not found" | Verify `ADO_PROJECT` matches exactly (case-sensitive). |
| "Invalid work item type" | Use `ado_list_work_item_types` to see valid types. |
| "Work item not found" | Check the ID. Use `ado_query_work_items` to search. |
| "No team specified" | Set `ADO_TEAM` env var, `ado.team` in settings, or pass `team` parameter. |
| "Repository not found" | Use `ado_list_repos` to find the correct repository ID or name. |
| "PR not found" | Use `ado_list_pull_requests` to find the correct PR ID. |
| "Rate limited" | Wait a moment and retry. Reduce query result counts. |
